ReactJS:-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-JavaScript is having libraries and frameworks.

libraries :- it is a collection of codes.
           - less set of rules.
           - reactjs , jquery etcc..

frameworks :- it is a collection of libraries
            - more set of rules. 
            - angular(2009) , vueJS etc..

importance of ReactJS:-
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) ReactJS is JavaScript library to build rich reusable user(declarative) interface.
2) ReactJS is faster because of "virtual DOM".
3) react follows component based architecture.
-reusability.
4) react follows unidirectional data flow.
5) react follows client-side rendering and server-side side rendering

-React was introduced in 2011 by facebook.
- Jordan Walke.
- 2013 react made as a open - source .
- react is a free and platform-independent.

to install react app :-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- install node js
- node -v

-npm install create-react-app --globally
-npm init react-app myapp (not begin with react and no capital letters)


single page application any changes is happening it will happen in one tap(modern appproacch
in multipage it takes many pages it takes many reloads(traditional approach)

-React is mainly used to create single page applications.

what is virtual DOM ?
virtual DOM is a virtual representation of a UI which is kept in a memory later synced with real DOM with the help of a library called react DOM library

the updating of real DOM with virtual DOM

the entire process of updating the RealDOM with the help of VDOM is called as Reconcialtion

JSX:-
- JSX stands for JAVASCRIPT and XML .
- JSX is a javascript syntax extention used to create HTML-like markup in the react .
- actual way to create a element in react is by using a method called as,
------React.createElement("tagname",{property:"value",content/children)
let ele = React.createElement("div",{className:"App"},React.createElement("h1",null,"header")

JSX is not a part of react but its recommended to use in react by the developer 

Rules of JSX:-
1)  every element irrespective of paired/unpaired tag both must be closed.
ex:- <h1></h1> , <input/>
2) more than one jsx element is used then they must wrapped with one parent 

JSX expression:-

- JSX expression is used to call the variable, mathematical expression inside the element.
Syntax:- <h1>{variable/expression}</h1>

components:-

-components are the files which conist of js related logics which can be reuse .

component are divided into two types:
1)
2)functional based components:

1)calss based components(CBC):-
-CBC is similar to javascript es6 class.
-CBC are "stateful" component because of default state object present inside the class.
syntax:- 

class Person{
	constructor(name,age){
		this.name=name;
		this.age = age;
	}
}
class Child extends Person{
	constructor(name,age,city){
		super(name,age);
		this.city=city;
	}
}

Syntax:- 
class App extends React.Component{
	render(){
		return(
		//JSX
		)
	}
}
export default App;

2)functional based component:-
-FBC are similar to JS functions.
-FBC are "Stateless because there is no state object until react V16.8









note:- while creating a react component the names must be started with capital letters.
-extension of a component file must be .jsx/.js
-how to call a component.
 <App> / <App></App>

component composition:-
-------------------------------------------
-component composition is used to combine multiple components into single application.

Props:-
------------
- props is nothing but properties similar to html attributes. 
- props is an object.
- props is an object used to exchange information or data from parent component to child component.

props.children


state:- 
**********
- state is an mutaual object which is used to store/isolate the date inside the component.

class component:-
****************
- class component is having the state object by default

syntax:- constructor(){
		super();
		this.state={
		users:["vikas","590"],
		num:100
	}

- to update the state object of a class component we have a method "this.setState({})


functional component:-
- by default functional component stateless because there is no state boject.
-in react v16.8 , they introduced a concept called as "Hooks".
syntax :- const[state,setState]= useState(inital value);
state - it will store initial value
setState - its used to update


2.useEffect():-
*********************
-it allows developers to make necessary changes /side effects inside the componet

syntax:- useEffect(callbackfn,,dependency);
